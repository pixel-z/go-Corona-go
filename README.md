# go-Corona-go

The projects aims to aid safe travelling for people by providing the safest path from a source to a destination.

Currently the implementation only consists of the locality in Delhi, but it can implemented such that it takes the locality of the user as a parameter.

### graph-parser-osm
Consists of Java program that parses OSM (OpenStreetMap) XML files into json graph representation.

* It was used to detect all the roads present in the given area (in the form of map.osm).
* Input given is the .osm file and output is the json file consisting of nodes which are intersection of roads with latitudes, longitudes, unique index and weights.
* This can be treated as a black-box or a tool to get the nodes of the graph.

## Instructions
To be done

## Implementation
* index.js is the master file.
* Given the starting & ending latitude and longitude we find the nearest node to these locations.
* Applying the modified `Djikstra algorithm` by adding risk factor in the weights (distance b/w nodes), gives us the shortest and safest path.
* The project currently consists of fake crowd data / simulation. It can easily be used on real data. `infected.json` consists of the latitude and longitude of the infected people which has been generated by `fake_data.py`. 
* The real world data can also be collected and refreshed in time intervals to give real time threat factor for the paths.
